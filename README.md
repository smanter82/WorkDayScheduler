# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Acceptance Criteria / Goals

1)  When a user opens the planner then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
2)  When the user scrolls down then he/she is presented with time blocks for standard business hours.
3)  When the user views the time blocks for that day then each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
4)  When the user clicks into a time block then he/she can enter an event.
5)  When the user clicks the save button for that time block, then the text for that event is saved in local storage.
6)  When the user refreshes the page then the saved events persist.
